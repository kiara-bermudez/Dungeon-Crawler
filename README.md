# Dungeon-Crawler

CSCE 121 HW: 

One of my favorite and most fun 121 assignments! I implemented the core game logic of a terminal retro dungeon crawler game. The goal of the game is to escape the dungeon while grabbing treasures and avoiding monsters!

Concepts covered:
- 2D dynamically allocated arrays
- Pass by Reference
- Creating test cases
- File streams
